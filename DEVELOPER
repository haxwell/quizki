In general, to run Quizki from scratch...

0. you'll need java, maven, tomcat, and mysql. Might as well go with the latest version of each.

Go to      https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/     and download the mysql connector. Expand the file you've downloaded. Inside the directory you should see a file with a name similar to mysql-connector-java-5.1.xx-bin.jar. Copy this file to your $JAVA_HOME/lib directory.



** Of course, be sure your servers are UP and RUNNING. **

Create a file in $TOMCAT_HOME/bin called setenv.sh

This file sets some environment variables that quizki will need while running in Tomcat

add the following contents to setenv.sh 

-----BEGIN------
#! /bin/sh

export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -DQUIZKI_JDBC_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quizki_db -DSHIRO_SERVER_NAME=localhost"
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
-----END--------

==> MySQL setup

From the $QUIZKI_HOME directory (where ever you saved QUIZKI on your machine is $QUIZKI_HOME), 
	* run the following command which will create a user named 'quizki' in your MySQL instance.

mysql -u root -p < ./src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/mysql/init_quizki_user.sql

	* run the following command which will populate the database that quizki uses

mysql -u root -p < ./src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/mysql/populate_database_quizkiDotCom_20150820.sql

==> Apache Shiro build

Move to a separate directory away from $QUIZKI_HOME, and run these commands

----BEGIN
git clone https://github.com/haxwell/apache-shiro-1.2.3.git
cd apache-shiro-1.2.3
git checkout 1.2.x
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----END

Expect an error, but if you see lines similar to these in the Maven output, then everything is OKAY!

[INFO] Apache Shiro ....................................... SUCCESS [ 23.175 s]
[INFO] Apache Shiro :: Core ............................... SUCCESS [ 30.892 s]
[INFO] Apache Shiro :: Web ................................ SUCCESS [ 10.196 s]

==> Build Quizki

from $QUIZKI_HOME, run the following command

	mvn clean package

It should build successfully, no errors!

Copy the WAR file we just generated to Tomcat, where it will automatically deploy it (make it available)

	cp target/quizki-1.3.war /home/jjames/apps/apache/tomcat/current/webapps/ROOT.war

Then in your browser, go to 

	http://localhost:8080

If all went well, you will see the Quizki home page!
